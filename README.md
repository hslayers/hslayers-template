# template-hslayers

This is a project template for [HSLayers-NG](https://ng.hslayers.org/) "full" apps. It lives at https://github.com/jmacura/template-hslayers.

To create a new project based on this template use degit:

```
npx degit jmacura/template-hslayers hslayers-app
cd hslayers-app
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](nodejs.org) installed.*

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```
cd hslayers-app
npm install
```

*Note that if you have npm < 7 you need to intall peer-dependencies manually.*

...then start Angular dev server:

```
npm run dev
```

Navigate to localhost:4200. You should see your app running. Edit a component file in src, save it, and the page should reload with your changes.

Idea for this project template was taken from https://github.com/sveltejs/template-webpack. Kudos to its authors.
